    <p>
      An very hands-off starch you're able to make while you're busy making the
      rest of your meal. Parmesan orzo might take 20 minutes on the stove top,
      but you'll spend less than five working on the hot and creamy side.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 stick or 8 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 lb orzo</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large cast iron skillet on medium high heat, put in butter and let
        melt, coating the entire bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the uncooked orzo pasta and spread across the entire pan so as
        much pasta as possible is touching it. Wait until the orzo has started
        to brown and then stir. Repeat until the orzo is very multicolored.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in chicken broth and stir. Place a lid on top and let simmer until
        the orzo has absorbed the broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and pour in the center the parmesan cheese. Mix
        thoroughly until the cheese is well incorporated and the whole dish is
        creamy. Remove from stove top and serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
